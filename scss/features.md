# Features

Sass/SCSS lets you use features that don't exist in CSS like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other goodies.



### Variables

Variables is a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet.

```css
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```
